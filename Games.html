  <h1>Games I enjoy</h1>
  <p>I've played a lot of games and this is my list of some of my favorites with a short summary of each</p>
  <h1>Omori</h1>
  <img id="Omori" src="images/omori.png" alt="Omori cover art by OMOCAT">
  <p>Omori is a game that I watched one of my friends play first before I tried it and I was instantly hooked</p>
  <p>You play as Omori and go through an adventure with seemingly random cuts of the story into something deeper.</p>
  <p>If you like games that have hidden levels of lore that you dig through, you'll definitely like this. The music in this game is phenominal.</p>
  <p>There are also different routes in the game that you could explore</p>
  <p>I have over 180 hours on the game trying to unlock all the achievements with 76% of them complete</p>
  <h1>Mario Galaxy</h1>

  <p>I grew up on the Mario franchise and Mario Galaxy will always be my favorite and the best game to come back to.</p>
  <p>It's nostalgic, it introduces the best princess of the three, Rosalina, introduces many new mechanics that are brought back in later games, and overall is a game that is like no other.</p>
  <p>I've played through it many times, at least 3 times, and it never gets boring. The music is also amazing.</p>

  <h1>Escape Simulator</h1>

  <p>Escape Simulator is exactly what you would think it is. Solving an escape room but in a game.</p>
  <p>There's many maps that come with the game as well as maps that you can download that are made by other people so there's always some new to do.</p>
  <p>It's multiplayer as well which makes it more fun to play with others. There's hints if you ever need help and it genuinely does make you think.</p>
